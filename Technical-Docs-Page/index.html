                       <h4>What is Python?</h4>
                        Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

                            It is used for:
                            <ul>
                               <li>web development (server-side),</li> 
                               <li>software development,</li>
                                <li>mathematics,</li>
                                <li>system scripting.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>What can Python do?</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Python can be used on a server to create web applications.</li>
                                <li>Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.</li>
                                <li>Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.</li>
                                <li>Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.</li>
                                <li>Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.</li>
                             </ul>

                             <h4>Why Python?</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).</li>
                                <li>Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.</li>
                                <li>Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.</li>
                                <li>Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.</li>
                                <li>Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-orientated way or a functional way.</li>
                            </ul>

                    <p>
                        Python is a very simple language, and has a very straightforward syntax. It encourages programmers to program without boilerplate (prepared) code. The simplest directive in Python is the "print" directive - it simply prints out a line (and also includes a newline, unlike in C).<br><br>

                        There are two major Python versions, Python 2 and Python 3. Python 2 and 3 are quite different. This tutorial uses Python 3, because it more semantically correct and supports newer features. <br><br>

                        For example, one difference between Python 2 and 3 is the print statement. In Python 2, the "print" statement is not a function, and therefore it is invoked without parentheses. However, in Python 3, it is a function, and must be invoked with parentheses. <br><br>

                        To print a string in Python 3, just write: <br><br>
                        <code>print("This line will be printed.")</code>

                <header>Variables and Types</header>
                <article>
                    <p>
                        Python is completely object oriented, and not "statically typed". You do not need to declare variables before using them, or declare their type. Every variable in Python is an object. <br><br>

                        This tutorial will go over a few basic types of variables. <br>
                        <h3>Numbers</h3>
                        <p>Python supports two types of numbers - integers and floating point numbers. (It also supports complex numbers, which will not be explained in this tutorial). <br><br>

                            To define an integer, use the following syntax:
                        </p>
                        <code>myint = 7  print(myint)</code>
                        <h3>Strings</h3>
                          <p>Strings are defined either with a single quote or a double quotes</p>
                          <code>mystring = "hello"  print(mystring)</code>
                    </p>
                </article>
            </section>
            <hr>
               <!--Fourth doc-->
               <section class="main-section" id="lists">
                <header>Lists</header>

                    <p>
                        Lists are very similar to arrays. They can contain any type of variable, and they can contain as many variables as you wish. Lists can also be iterated over in a very simple manner. <br><br> Here is an example of how to build a list. <br>
                     <code>
                         mylist = []
                         mylist.append(1)
                         mylist.append(2)
                         mylist.append(3)
                         print(mylist[0]) # prints 1
                         print(mylist[1]) # prints 2
                         print(mylist[2]) # prints 3
                            
                            # prints out 1,2,3
                            for x in mylist:
                                print(x)</code>
                    </p>

                <article>
                    <p>This section explains how to use basic operators in Python.</p>
                    <h3>Arithmetic operators</h3>
                    <p>Just as any other programming languages, the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operators can be used with numbers.</p><br>
                    <code> number = 1 + 2 * 3 / 4.0  print(number) #prints 2.5</code>

                    <p>Using two multiplication symbols makes a power relationship</p>
            <code>
    squared = 7 ** 2
    cubed = 2 ** 3
    print(squared) #prints 49
    print(cubed)  #prints 8</code>

              <section class="main-section" id="string">
                <header>String Formatting</header>
                <article>
                    <p>Python uses C-style string formatting to create new, formatted strings. The "%" operator is used to format a set of variables enclosed in a "tuple" (a fixed size list), together with a format string, which contains normal text together with "argument specifiers", special symbols like "%s" and "%d". <br>

                        Let's say you have a variable called "name" with your user name in it, and you would then like to print(out a greeting to that user.)</p>
                        <code># This prints out "Hello, John!"      
             name = "John"     
             print("Hello, %s!" % name)</code><br>

             <p>To use two or more argument specifiers, use a tuple (parentheses):</p>
                            <code># This prints out "John is 23 years old."
            name = "John"
            age = 23
            print("%s is %d years old." % (name, age))</code><br>
